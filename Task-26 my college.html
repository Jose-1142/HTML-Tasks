    <pre>
        Bishop Ambrose College, a Roman Catholic Arts and Science Institution was established in the year 1997. The Coimbatore Diocese Society which has established
         a number of educational institutions in and around Coimbatore district in the cause of serving humanity chose to fulfill a long felt need to
          open a new college for the benefit of Young men and women.
        The 150 th year celebration of Diocese and the Silver Jubilee of the Episcopal Ordination of the then President of the society, 
        Most Rev. Dr. M. Ambrose, D.D.,D.C.L., became the memorable occasion for the establishment of this co-educational institution in the city.
        The College was formally inaugurated by his Excellency, the Most Rev. Dr. M. Ambrose in November 1997. Initially it functioned in a separate block at Carmel Garden School campus.
         In January 1999, the college shifted to a permanent spacious campus at College Nagar, near Sungam.
        The College had it modest start with just 40 students on the rolls in B.Sc. (Comp.Science), BBM, B.Com. and BCS programmes.
        BAC has worked through 24 years in shaping the lives of young men and women and offers 12 UG programmes and 2 PG programmes.
         The College has miles to go with its rich tradition.
        The college provides meaningful education for the sound formation of the youth to make them grow as responsible 
        individuals and good citizens with noble character. It aims at training the youth in sterling qualities to become leaders in all
        walks in life, to build a better society, inculcating desirable values so that they help to form a harmonious society 
        based on brotherhood.
